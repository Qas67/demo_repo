untracked files are the files that  git doeasn't know about them so we need track the files before saving them to git. TO track the files we use "git add ."(. indicates that all the files which are untracked and modified section should be tracked) command.

git commit -m "Here we have to write about the title of the commit" -m "here we will write about the description of the commit". By these changes the commit is there locally but for to push them to online we use the command git push command so to prove that we first need to connect our local git with github repoistry online so to do that we sue the concept of ssh keys.

We generate the ssh key on git terminal using command ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email address of github"
